# Babysitter Finder

This project was developed as part of the Android Development course in my 2nd year of Computer Science.
The database for this project is Firebase, and the IDE used is Android Studio.

## Main Functions:
1. **Registration**: There are 3 types of users: Customer, Service Provider, and Admin. Each has different functions (Admin can only be created manually).
When a service provider registers, they need to provide additional details and must be verified by an Admin.

2. **Login**: Standard login page.

3. **Homepage**: For users, the homepage displays Service Providers in their area (provided during registration, but can be changed while using the app). For Admins, the homepage contains a list of Service Providers to review and accept.

4. **Personal Info**: On this page, users can change several personal details (options may vary between Customer and Service Provider).

5. **Provider Pop-Up**: Upon clicking on a Service Provider, a window will pop up containing additional details about the provider, along with an option to leave a star rating for the provider.
